* Oracle Application express (APEX) 5.0.4 installed and upgraded from the original version in the XE database
* Oracle REST data services 3.0.9 (ORDS) configured for the XE database.
* Installed REST_DATA schema as provided with the sql scripts in this demo
* Installed version of LiveCode 9.0-DP5 or higher to compile REST.livecode into a Javascript client.
* Firefox/Safari or Chrome browser
* Desktop client uses Plotly.js framework and some calls to built-in javascript functionality directly in the client to plot graphs.

The Project is currently in developemnt. Expect some more detailed instructions on setup and usage in the first quarter of 2017.
